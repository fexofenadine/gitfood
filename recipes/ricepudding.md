# Rice Pudding

## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup rice long grain or short grain, uncooked
- 4 cup milk
- ⅓ cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Method

> 1. DO NOT USE THE CUP THAT COMES WITH THE RICE COOKER, use a regular measuring cup!
> 2. Put the rice and milk in the rice cooker bowl and stir to combine.
> 3. Close the cover and set for the Porridge cycle.
> 4. When the machine switches to the "Keep Warm" cycle, open the rice cooker, and add the sugar and vanilla, and stir until combined.
> 5. Close the cover and reset for a second Porridge cycle. Stir every 15 to 20 minutes until the desired consistency is reached. Rice mixture will thicken as it cools. If it comes out too thick, just add more milk.
> 6. Serve warm or let cool slightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
> 7. When cold, cover with plastic wrap and store for up to 4 days.
