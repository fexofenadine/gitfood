# Rissoles

## Ingredients

Place into a large bowl:
- 500g minced steak
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 piece of bread, pulled into little bits, crust & all
- 1 egg
- Pinch salt & pepper
- About ¼ cup tomato sauce

## Method 

> 1. Put a heap of plain flour on a plate
> 2. Wet your hands & stick them into the mix, & mix & mix & squeeze & mix
> 3. Grab about a ¼ cup of mix & roll into a ball
> 4. Roll & pat in the flour - you can do this one at a time or do the rolling then the flouring.
> 5. Fry in moderately hot olive oil until very brown.
> 6. I turn them about 4 times & give them a squash just as I put them in pan.
> 7. I also add chopped parsley & a bit of garlic but these aren’t in the original recipe.
> 8. I reckon good ol tomato sauce is the best but do what takes your fancy.
> 9. I reckon mashed potatoes & whatever veg you want - the spuds are great to clean your plate of sauce & bits of rissoles - yum!
