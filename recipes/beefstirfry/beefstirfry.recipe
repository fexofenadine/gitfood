# Beef Stir Fry

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 500g beef, sliced into strips (about 1cm wide)
- 1 onion, sliced or diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried ginger
- 1 tsp chilli flakes
- 2 capsicums, sliced
- 2 cups green vegetables
- 1-2 cups cabbage, sliced
- 1 tbsp honey
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 450g hokkien/egg noodles

## Method

> 1. Add 1 tbsp oil to a large, deep frypan or wok on medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli.  Cook for 3 minutes.
> 1. Add beef pieces and cook for about 5 minutes, until browned thoroughly. The onion will be very soft and the beef should be reasonably tender.
> 1. In a separate bowl, mix together soy sauce, lemon juice and honey.
> 1. Add vegetables/capsicum/cabbage, along with the noodles. Add the honey soy mixture and stir well until everything is well coated in the sauce, and cook for 3-5 minutes.

## Tips

> - The honey soy sauce can be replaced entirely with a bought mix (think Teriyaki, Chinese Stir Fry, etc), or experimented with for many variations on flavour.
> - You can easily omit adding the noodles during step 4, and serve over cooked rice, or over noodles instead.
> - The vegetables can be swapped around to nearly anything available in your area/season.
