# Fritters

## Ingredients

### Lamb

- leftover roast lamb or whatever cold cooked meat (eg. ham , chicken etc.)
- vegies, any sort you want, usually
    - corn
    - carrots
    - peas
    - a bit of onion or shallots  
### Batter

- 2 cups self raising flour
- pinch of salt & pepper
- 1 or 2 eggs & milk to 

## Method

Mix all the batter ingredients into a thick liquid - not too runny.

Add your choice of stuff to go in & fry a tablespoon size in a combination of olive oil & butter, on a moderate heat. Turn them when bubbles start to form & pop on top - they should be golden brown. Once again tomato sauce is great on top!!! The butter gives a great flavour & the olive oil stops it from burning- you might have to add more if these to the pan after each batch
