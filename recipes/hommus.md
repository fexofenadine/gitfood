# Hommus

## Ingredients

- 425g can (or 1½ cups cooked) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- ½ tsp baking soda (if you’re using canned chickpeas)
- ¼ cup lemon juice (from 1½ to 2 lemons), more to taste
- 1 medium-large clove garlic, roughly chopped
- ½ tsp fine sea salt, to taste
- ½ cup tahini
- 2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, more as needed
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- [optional garnishes] olive oil/zhoug sauce/ground sumac/paprika/fresh parsley


## Method

> 1. Place the chickpeas in a medium saucepan and add the baking soda. Cover the chickpeas by several (5 to 10) cm of water, then bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue boiling, reducing heat if necessary to prevent overflow, for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas look bloated, their skins are falling off, and they’re quite soft. In a fine mesh strainer, drain the chickpeas and run cool water over them for about 30 seconds.
> 1. Meanwhile, in a food processor or high-powered blender, combine the lemon juice, garlic and salt. Process until the garlic is very finely chopped, then let the mixture rest so the garlic flavor can mellow, ideally 10 minutes or longer.
> 1. Add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the processor as necessary.
> 1. While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water. Scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale and creamy. (If your tahini was extra-thick to begin with, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water.)
> 1. Add the cumin and the drained chickpeas to the food processor. While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.
> 1. Taste, and adjust as necessary. Add another ¼ teaspoon salt for more flavor or extra lemon juice for more zing.
> 1. Scrape the hommus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top. Top with garnishes of your choice, and serve.
