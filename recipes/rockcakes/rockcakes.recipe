# Rock Cakes

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups self raising flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 115g butter
- 115g sultanas
- 50g mixed peel
- 75g caster sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1-3 tbsp of milk

## Method
1. Sift flour & baking powder into a large bowl. Rub in butter with fingers until it resembles bread crumbs. Stir in fruit & peel, sugar.

2. Beat eggs & milk & mix into dry ingredients adding more milk if mixture is too dry

3. Place tablespoons of mixture onto a greased or papered tray, leaving spreading space. Sprinkle with sugar on top

4. Bake 15-20 mins until golden in 200â€™c & cool , then hook in!

## Tips
- A very basic recipe & I find that eating them on the day of making is best cause they stale quickly, but if any are left put into an airtight container.
