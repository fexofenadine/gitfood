# Roasted Capsicum

## Ingredients

- Capsicum
- Olive oil

## Method

> 1. Cut the capsicum in half, removing the seeds and white membrane.
> 1. Place skin side up on a cooking tray. Spray with cooking oil, or drizzle with olive oil.
> 1. Pop the tray under a hot grill for 10 minutes, or until the skins have blistered and blackened slightly.
> 1. Fold the lining foil up and over the capsicum while it is still on the tray. This will cause them to steam, making it easier to peel away the skin.
> 1. Leave for 10 minutes, or until cool enough to handle. Using your fingers, peel away the skins.

## Tips

> - If you’re not using them immediately, place your capsicums in a resealable jar and cover with olive oil.
> - They’ll store in the fridge for two weeks, or you can freeze them for up to two months.
