# Rissoles

## Ingredients

Place into a large bowl:
- 500g minced steak
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 piece of bread- pulled into little bits , crust & all
- 1 egg
- Pinch salt & pepper
- About 1/4 cup tomato sauce

## Method 

1. Put a heap of plain flour on a plate

2. Wet your hands & stick them into the mix & mix & mix & squeeze & mix

3. Grab about a 1/4 cup of mix & roll into a ball
4. Roll & pat in the flour - you can do this 1 at a time or do the rolling then the flouring.

5. Fry in moderately hot olive oil until very brown.

6. I turn them about 4 times & give them a squash just as I put them in pan.

7. I also add chopped parsley & a bit of garlic but these arenâ€™t in the original recipe.

8. I reckon good ol tomato sauce is the best but do what takes your fancy.

9. I reckon mashed potatoes & whatever veg you want - the spuds are great to clean your plate of sauce & bits of rissoles- yum!
