# Beef Stroganoff

## Ingredients

- 600g beef pieces
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 large onion
- 300g mushrooms, sliced coarsely
- 3 tbsp (40g) butter
- 2 tbsp flour
- 2 cups (500ml) beef stock
- 1 tbsp dijon mustard
- â…” cup (150ml) sour cream
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

> 1. Sprinkle beef with a pinch of salt and pepper
> 1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat. Scatter half the beef in the skillet.  Quickly spread it with tongs. Leave untouched for 30 seconds to brown. Turn beef quickly (as best you can). Leave untouched for 30 seconds to brown. Immediately remove onto a plate. Don't worry about pink bits showing, it can remain raw inside at this stage.
> 1. Add remaining 1 tbsp oil and repeat with remaining beef.
> 1. Turn heat down to medium high. Add butter, melt. Then add onions, cook for 1 minute, then add mushrooms.
> 1. Cook mushrooms until golden. Scrape bottom of fry pan to get all the golden bits off (good flavouring).
> 1. Add flour, cook, stirring, for one minute.
> 1. Add half the broth while stirring. Once incorporated, add remaining broth.
> 1. Stir, then add sour cream and mustard. Stir until incorporated (don't worry if it looks split, sour cream will melt as it heats).
> 1. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat to medium low. Once it thickens to the consistency of pouring cream (3-5 minutes), adjust salt and pepper to taste.
> 1. Add beef back in (including plate juices). Simmer for 1 minute, the remove from stove immediately.
> 1. Serve over rice or pasta.
