# Banana Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 ripe banana
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp wholemeal self-raising flour
- [optional] 1 tsp cacao (or cocoa) powder

## Method

> 1. Mash banana in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk in egg, then flour until smooth. Set aside for 5 minutes.
> 1. Lightly spray a medium non-stick frying pan with oil and heat over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons batter into pan and spread out with the back of a spoon until 1cm thick. Repeat with remaining batter to make 2 more pancakes.
