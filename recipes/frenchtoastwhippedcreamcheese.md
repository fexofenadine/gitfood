# French Toast with Whipped Cream Cheese

## Ingredients

### Bread batter

(enough for 1 loaf of sourdough (~14 small-medium sized slices))
Serves 4-5

- 1 loaf of sourdough, slightly older will hold together best. Other breads may work well too.
- 6 eggs
- 1½ cups milk
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp salt

### Whipped cream cheese

- 150ml cream
- ~50g cream cheese
- 1½ tbsp icing sugar

## Method

> 1. Whip the cream, cheese and sugar for maybe 5-10 mins (probably longer with a hand-whisk) until it gets really thick and floofy. Refrigerate until serving.
> 2. Combine batter ingredients and whisk well in a shallow, wide bowl. The salt component supposedly helps it absorb into the bread(?)
> 3. Preheat pan with butter, medium-high to high heat. If the heat is too low, the egg wont completely set, and too high and the outside will blacken, so try a single piece of toast or two before cooking a panful
> 4. Soak a few pieces of bread in the batter for 20-30 seconds and transfer direct from bowl to hot frying pan
> 5. Cook for 4-5 minutes, flipping a few times, until it looks a bit like a cooked, browned pancake.
> 6. Slap it on a plate, with the cream and maple syrup or whatever toppings you like and enjoy!

## Variations

> - Many other toppings, including icing sugar, ice cream, chocolate syrup, berries, agave nectar. Anything that's good on a pancake will probably be great here.
> - Use a multigrain bread for a little more texture and extra fibre.
