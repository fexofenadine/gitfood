# French Toast with Whipped Cream Cheese

## Ingredients

### Bread batter 

(enough for 1 loaf of sourdough (~14 small-medium sized slices) serves 4-5)

- 6 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Whipped cream cheese 

(this was about 2x the amount we needed for this amount of bread lol)

- 300ml cream
- ~100g cream cheese
- 3 tbsp icing sugar

## Method

1. whip the shit out of the cream, cheese and sugar for maybe 5-10 mins (probably longer with a hand-whisk) until it gets real thick and floofy. refrigerate until serving.

2. combine batter ingredients and whisk well in a shallow, wide bowl. the salt component supposedly helps it absorb into the bread(?)

3. preheat pan with butter, medium-high to high heat. if the heat is too low, the egg wont completely set, and too high and the outside will blacken, so try a single piece of toast or two before cooking a panful

4. soak a few pieces of bread in the batter for 20-30 seconds and transfer direct from bowl to hot frying pan

5. cook for 4-5 minutes, flipping a few times, until it looks a bit like a cooked, browned pancake.

6. slap it on a plate, with the cream and maple syrup or whatever and eat that shit
