1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Place the flour, coconut, butter and sugar in a bowl and mix to combine. Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture into the base of a lightly greased 20cm x 30cm tin lined with non-stick baking paper and bake for 15–20 minutes or until golden.

2. While the base is cooking, make the caramel filling.
    
    Place the butter, condensed milk and golden syrup, in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until the butter is melted and cook, whisking frequently, for 5–7 minutes or until the mixture has thickened slightly (see tip). .

    Pour the caramel over the cooked base, spread evenly with a palette knife and cook for 15–20 minutes or until golden. Cool slightly and refrigerate until cold

3. To make the chocolate topping, place the chocolate and oil in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and stir until melted and smooth. Pour the chocolate over the caramel mixture and spread evenly. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until firm. Using a warm knife, cut into slices or squares to serve. Makes 20 squares

## Tip
- When stirring the caramel, scrape the sides and bottom of the pan so the mixture doesn’t stick.
