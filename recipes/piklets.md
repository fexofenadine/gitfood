# Piklets

## Ingredients

- 2 cups self raising flour
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons of golden syrup
- Milk
- Butter
- Lemon juice

## Method

Mix all the wet ingredients together - youâ€™ll have to beat hard but not for long, to blend the syrup into mix, then add enough milk to get a thick, runny batter.

Use butter to cook them in (all this butter !!!). A tablespoon full for each one & cook in moderately hot pan until the bubbles appear & turn , they should be golden brown. A squeeze of lemon juice & a sprinkle of sugar is delicious when hot - butter (again) or margarine spread on when cold.
