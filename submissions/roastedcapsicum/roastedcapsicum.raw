### Title of Recipe

Roasted Capsicum

### Ingredients

Capsicum
Olive oil

### Method

Cut the capsicum in half, removing the seeds and white membrane.
Place skin side up on a cooking tray. Spray with cooking oil, or drizzle with olive oil.
Pop the tray under a hot grill for 10 minutes, or until the skins have blistered and blackened slightly.
Fold the lining foil up and over the capsicum while it is still on the tray. This will cause them to steam, making it easier to peel away the skin.
Leave for 10 minutes, or until cool enough to handle. Using your fingers, peel away the skins.

### Tips

If you’re not using them immediately, place your capsicums in a resealable jar and cover with olive oil.
They’ll store in the fridge for two weeks, or you can freeze them for up to two months.
