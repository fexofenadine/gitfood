### Title of Recipe

Kimchi Pancakes

### Ingredients

1 cup thinly sliced, fully-fermented kimchi
1-2 spring onions (two if thin and small)
¼ medium onion
cooking oil with high smoke point for pan frying
[optional] 90g minced pork

1¼ cups all-purpose flour or buchimgaru (Korean pancake premix) or Swap 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour with sweet rice flour or corn/potato starch
2-3 tbsp juice/liquid from kimchi
1 cup icy cold water
[optional] 1-2 tsp gochujang (Korean chili pepper paste) or gochugaru
[optional] 1 lightly beaten egg

1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp vinegar
1 tbsp water
½ tsp sugar
pinch of black pepper

### Method

Thinly slice the kimchi, about 1-1½cm thick. Cut the spring onions into about 5cm pieces. If the white part is thick, cut in half lengthwise. Thinly slice the onion.
In a large bowl, combine the flour (or pancake mix) with the liquid from kimchi, the optional gochujang/gochugaru and egg, and water, a little bit at a time. Start with dissolving the gochujang with water, and mix everything together. Do not over mix.
Add a little more water if the batter is too thick. The batter should flow easily from a spoon.
Stir in the kimchi, spring onions, onion and the optional protein of your choice.
Heat one tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Ladle the mixture into the pan, and spread it evenly into a thin round shape. Cook until the edges turn light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Turn it over, and add more oil to the sides of the pan. Gently swirl the pan to distribute the oil under the pancakes. Press the pancake down with a spatula. Cook until the other side is nicely browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes.
Repeat the process until there is no remaining batter. Serve hot with a dipping sauce, if desired.






### Tips

Use juice/liquid from kimchi if at all possible.
Use icy cold water.
The batter should be thin enough to flow easily from a spoon.
Spread the batter thin when pan frying.
Use a generous amount of oil.
Increase the heat a little to crisp up the pancakes at the end of pan-frying.
